currently:

- LMCP string
- message length i32
top struct
    - 15-byte header
    field
        - arrays: size of array and then contents
        - base types / structs

blind / naive:
    - length smaller than true: any data received after reported end is passed on
    - legth longer than true: any data after true end is written into structs
        - both for message length and array sizes

network abstraction to have a witness for size? zeromq does this i think
    zeromq: pub/sub architecture
    guarantee: no partial message

    need: full messages, publish/subscribe model?
