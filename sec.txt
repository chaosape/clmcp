security properties
===

confidentiality
---

property we need: read-set <= information given in serialization (information actually in buffer)

- prevent read outside buffer allocation during deserialize

- prevent manipulation of struct pointers to read arbitrary data during serialization
    - ie, program system so that no malicious entities can access internal representation of data

integrity
---

write-set = 0

packing into a buffer not allocated properly

unpacking into bad memory

availability

DoS protection



TODO:
- add length / 'gas' parameter to pack/unpack functions for bounds checking
    (be sure this is done in an arithmetic-safe way)

- move buffer allocation to inside the API
